The program we created allows companies to create an invoice for their customers. It makes this process really easy
and is very straightforward in its application.

The program is currently focused on a grocery store, but its use can easily be extended to any kind of business.
The remainder of this text provides information on how the program should be used.

The first thing a company needs to consider before making use of the program is entering the different goods that they
sell and the according prices into a csv file. Our program is not limited to any number of goods so this does not
restrict large businesses from adopting our program. Once the products and prices are inserted, one can press “1”
to start with the invoice-creating process.

The first step after launching the process is to check whether we are creating an invoice for an existing or for a
new client. We filter this by looking at the name of the client. The existing client database is automatically opened
in order to take a look whether we face an existing client or not. In this phase, we assume for simplicity that there are
no clients with identical names. In the case of an existing client, the employee should insert the name as it is known
in our database and in that case the program retrieves the corresponding data on ZIP code and address from our database.
If we are dealing with a new client, we ask this data regarding his address and save it for a possible next invoice.

The next step is to take the order of the client. The products are easily distinguished from each other after adding
product numbers for each different product. When arriving at this step, this product list is opened so that the employer
can look for which product numbers belong to this invoice. First, the employer inserts how many different orders should
be displayed on the invoice, and second he enters the quantities of each different product.

After filling in the final product quantity, we show a preview of the invoice to the employee. It is important to take
a close look at this invoice to correct whether everything on the invoice is right. When the employee approves the
invoice, he presses "1", and from that moment the invoice is saved into the database.
